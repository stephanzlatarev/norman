Intel skills collect data about the enemy to inform strategic economy and military decisions.

### Early scout

The early scout is a worker sent to the enemy base at the start of the game.
It will:
* Test if enemy workers defend themselves. If not, it will kill as many as possible before countered by military units.
* Detect enemy expansion. If there's no expansion, it will block it as long as possible.
