The strategy of playing StarCraft II is as follows:

1. Continuously determine the deployment outreach based on our economy strength and the percieved balance between own and enemy forces
    - siege defense - overwhelming enemy attack is imminent; defend the largest defendable perimeter with all warriors behind walls; abandon exposed outposts if necessary.
    - normal defense - station warriors in economy perimeter and watch approaches
    - expand defense - secure the next outpost with the intent to build a new base
    - probing attack - test enemy lines for weaknesses and keep main army ready to return to defense
    - normal offense - create multi-pronged attacks on weakest enemy zones with the intent to build forces and upgrade technology
    - full offense - when maxed out, create aggressive attacks with the intent to rotate forces into more powerful army composition
2. Zone the map to set the boundaries of the effective deployment outreach
    - Scout the map
        - Send a probe to the enemy base at the start
        - Constantly send hallucinated phoenixes to all zones in the fog of war
    - Model zones of the map in memory in layered perimeters
        - harvest perimeter - own harvest lines
        - economy perimeter - own production structures
        - outpost perimeter - selected zones for expansion
        - approach perimeter - neighboring zones to own harvest, economy, outpost; needs monitoring
        - defense perimeter - challenged neighboring zones; close zones with non-warrior enemy presence
        - offense perimeter - zones with enemy warrior presence
        - enemy perimeter - zones with enemy harvest lines
3. Harvest minerals and vespene as much as possible within the limits of the effective deployment outreach
    - Use jit mining to harvest minerals with up to 5 workers per pair of minerals
    - Continuously train probes within the limits in memory when the active nexuses are not saturated
    - Build pylons when reaching the supply limit
    - Build assimilators on free geysers when reaching the saturation for the active mineral fields and assimilators
    - Build nexuses within the limits in memory when reaching saturation for the active nexuses
4. Manage production to support the effective deployment outreach
    - Model target army composition based on the percieved balance between own and enemy forces - priority and limit in memory per unit type
    - Build technology and production structures to meet the needs of the target army composition
    - Continuously train army units within the limits in memory
5. Coordinate battles and harassment missions with aggression levels depending on the effective deployment outreach
    - Maintain an ordered list of battles by priority. Battles may be front attacks with may combat units or harrassment missions with a few specialists.
    - Assign the required warriors to the battles by priority. Direct battles according to the balance between deployed own forces and anticipated enemy forces.
